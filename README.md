- 👋 Hi, I’m @ebylaska
- 👀 I’m developing 
  + :microscope: plane-wave electronic structure methods, 
  + ✨periodic and aperiodic plane-wave many-body approaches✨, 
  + :robot: chemical workflows methods, 
  + and :tv: visualization tools. 
- 	:seedling: I’m interested in chemical reaction networks and the development of tools to model and interpret them.
- :writing_hand: I'm currently learning how to derive DFPT and CPHF derivatives.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on testing the aperiodic and periodic COVOs methods.
- 📫 How to reach me is at eric.bylaska@pnnl.gov
