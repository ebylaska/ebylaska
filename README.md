- 👋 Hi, I’m @ebylaska
- 👀 I’m developing plane-wave electronic structure methods, periodic and aperiodic plane-wave many-body approaches, chemical workflows methods, and visualization tools. 
- 👀 I’m interested in chemical reaction networks and the development of tools to model and interpret them.
- 🌱 I'm currently learning how to derive DFPT and CPHF derivatives.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on testing the aperiodic and periodic COVOs methods.
- 📫 How to reach me is at eric.bylaska@pnnl.gov
